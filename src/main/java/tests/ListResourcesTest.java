	"text": ["A growing body of evidence supports the concept that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a metabolic disease that results from impaired insulin signaling, insulin resistance, and low levels of insulin in the brain.  Because the molecular and biochemical consequences of impaired insulin signaling are shared with Type I and Type 2 diabetes, the term \u201CType 3 diabetes\u201D has been suggested for AD.  There is also evidence that people who have Type 2 diabetes have a heightened risk of developing AD.  Understanding the possible associations between Type 2 diabetes and AD may lead to effective early diagnosis and treatment of AD.  It may also help to identify patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for developing AD.  In this article, we examine the possible associations between Type 2 diabetes and AD. ", "The information contained in this article will enhance student comprehension of the neuroendocrine system and their appreciation for the current research associated with a possible link between Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Diabetes, associated with the pedagogy of courses in Human Anatomy and Physiology, Human Physiology, Advanced Physiology and Neurobiology. IntroductionThe first indication that patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) appeared in the Rotterdam study (Dar et al. 2014), a prospective study that has been ongoing since 1990 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (Ikram et al. 2017).  Participants in the Rotterdam study, who currently number 14,926 individuals over the age of 40, are monitored for a variety of diseases that are known to affect the elderly, among them: heart disease, stroke, AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis.  The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, initiated in 1990 to study abnormalities associated with dementia in 3734 Japanese-American men and closed in 2012 (Gelber etal. 2012), similarly found a strong association between T2DM and AD (Peila et al.2002).  The number of people who suffer from these diseases is staggering. Conservative estimates put the number of people with AD at 36 million worldwide and that number is expected to double every twenty years until 2040 (Narasimhan 2014).  The number of people who suffer from diabetes may exceed 347 million worldwide (Yang and Song 2013).  Diabetes mellitus is associated with the subsequent development of AD in the aging population (Dar et al. 2014) and people with T2DM are believed to be 50-65% more likely to develop AD as they age compared to people who are not diabetic (Dar et al. 2014, http:\/\/dlife.com\/type-3-diabetes, www.diabetes.co.uk\/type3-diabetes.html).  There is currently a debate about the degree to which T2DM and perhaps T1DM contribute to the pathogenesis of AD that centers on the rising prevalence of obesity, T2DM and AD over the past 20 years.  Some degree of association between diabetes and AD is suggested by the following (de la Monte and Wands 2008):1.  An increased risk for developing mild cognitiveimpairment (MCI), dementia, or AD in patients who havebeen diagnosed with T2DM.2.  The presence of progressive insulin resistance (IR) andinsulin deficiency that has been observed in the brain ofAlzheimer\u2019s patients.3.  Observations of cognitive impairment in animal modelsof T2DM and obesity.4.  Neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in animalmodels where IR or insulin deficiency have been induced.5.  Observations of improved cognitive performance inexperimental animals who have received intranasalinsulin treatment for cognitive impairment.6.  The presence of several biochemical and molecularabnormalities that are shared in T2DM and AD.(de la Monte and Wands 2008)continued on next page\n"],

In livers and muscles of mice fasted for 12\u201348 hours cAMP levels, Rpn6 phosphorylation, and proteasomal activities increased without any change in proteasomal content. Thus, in vivo cAMP-PKA\u2013mediated proteasome activation is a common cellular response to diverse endocrine stimuli and rapidly enhances the capacity of target tissues to degrade regulatory and misfolded proteins (e.g., proteins damaged upon exercise).

	"text": ["An understanding of the regulatory mechanism for sleep lays at the foundation for healthy living and aging. Sleep behavior has long been thought to be regulated by the interactions of circadian clock and sleep homeostasis pathways (Borbély, 1982Borbély A.A. A two process model of sleep regulation.Hum. Neurobiol. 1982; 1: 195-204PubMed\nGoogle Scholar, Borbély et al., 2016Borbély A.A. Daan S. Wirz-Justice A. Deboer T. The two-process model of sleep regulation: a reappraisal.J.

Timing of human sleep: recovery process gated by a circadian pacemaker.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R161-R183PubMed\nGoogle Scholar). In humans, variations of genetically inherited sleep features in the population have been recognized for a long time (Sehgal and Mignot, 2011Sehgal A. Mignot E. Genetics of sleep and sleep disorders.Cell. 2011; 146: 194-207Abstract\nFull Text\nFull Text PDF\nPubMed\nScopus (179)\nGoogle Scholar, Shi et al., 2017Shi G. Wu D. Ptáček L.J. Fu Y.-H. Human genetics and sleep behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 44: 43-49Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (3)\nGoogle Scholar). Importantly, human sleep has unique features that are different from that of animal models. For example, human sleep is usually consolidated, whereas mice sleep throughout the 24-h day (though more in the light phase than in the dark phase). Drosophila sleep-like behavior is consolidated into one long period, but the level of similarity between the Drosophila and human molecular regulatory mechanisms remains unclear. Previously, we identified a series of genetic variations that influence the timing of sleep in humans, and mouse models of these mutations mostly recapitulate the phenotypes (Shi et al., 2017Shi G. Wu D. Ptáček L.J. Fu Y.-H. Human genetics and sleep behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 44: 43-49Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (3)\nGoogle Scholar). Timing of sleep is heavily influenced by the circadian clock, which has been intensely studied, and we now have a large and growing body of knowledge on how the clock is regulated at the molecular level. On the other hand, our understanding of sleep homeostasis regulation for human lags behind. We reported a mutation in the human DEC2 gene that causes mutation carriers to sleep 6 h nightly for their entire lives without apparent negative effects (He et al., 2009He Y. Jones C.R. Fujiki N. Xu Y. Guo B. Holder J.L. Rossner M.J. Nishino S. Fu Y.H. The transcriptional repressor DEC2 regulates sleep length in mammals.Science. 2009; 325: 866-870Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (171)\nGoogle Scholar). Another mutation in DEC2 was later reported in a single individual who is a short sleeper and resistant to sleep deprivation (Pellegrino et al., 2014Pellegrino R. Kavakli I.H. Goel N. Cardinale C.J. Dinges D.F. Kuna S.T. Maislin G. Van Dongen H.P. Tufik S. Hogenesch J.B. et al.A novel BHLHE41 variant is associated with short sleep and resistance to sleep deprivation in humans.Sleep (Basel). 2014; 37: 1327-1336Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (0)\nGoogle Scholar). Identification of additional genes participating in modulation of human sleep duration provides a unique way to expand our knowledge of genes and pathways critical for human sleep homeostasis regulation.Noradrenergic signaling in the CNS has long been known to regulate sleep (Berridge, 2008Berridge C.W. Noradrenergic modulation of arousal.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 58: 1-17Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (0)\nGoogle Scholar, Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A.

Functional neuroanatomy of the central noradrenergic system.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 659-693Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (104)\nGoogle Scholar). The network involving the noradrenergic neurons has been extensively studied, and most of the receptor subtypes have been genetically defined. In contrast to α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors (ARs), relatively little is known about the function of β receptors in the CNS (Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A. Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness\/arousal.Sleep Med. Rev. 2012; 16: 187-197Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (121)\nGoogle Scholar, Szabadi, 2013Szabadi E. Functional neuroanatomy of the central noradrenergic system.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 659-693Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (104)\nGoogle Scholar). βARs within the brain were previously suggested to mediate the effect of norepinephrine (NE) for alert waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A. Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness\/arousal.Sleep Med. Rev. 2012; 16: 187-197Crossref\nPubMed\nScopus (121)\nGoogle Scholar). Clinically, β-blockers are widely used and can be associated with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, possibly due to reduced production and release of melatonin (Helfand et al., 2009Helfand M.

We report here a rare mutation in the β1AR gene (ADRB1) found in humans with natural short sleep. Engineering the human mutation into mice resulted in a sleep phenotype similar to that seen in familial natural short sleepers. We show that β1AR is expressed at high levels in the dorsal pons (DP). Neuronal activity measured by calcium imaging in this region demonstrated that ADRB1+ neurons in DP are wake and REM sleep active. Manipulating the activity of these ADRB1+ neurons changes sleep\/wake patterns. Also, the activity of these neurons was altered in mice harboring the mutation. Together, these results not only support the causative role of this ADRB1 mutation in the human subjects but also provide a mechanism for investigating noradrenaline and β1AR in sleep regulation at the circuit level."],

Here, we describe a human case with a homozygous nonsense R688* RC3H1 mutation suffering from hyperinflammation, presenting as relapsing HLH. RC3H1 encodes Roquin-1, a posttranscriptional repressor of immune-regulatory proteins such as ICOS, OX40 and TNF. Comparing the R688* variant with the murine M199R variant reveals a phenotypic resemblance, both in immune cell activation, hypercytokinemia and disease development. Mechanistically, R688* Roquin-1 fails to localize to P-bodies and interact with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex, impeding mRNA decay and dysregulating cytokine production. The results from this unique case suggest that impaired Roquin-1 function provokes hyperinflammation by a failure to quench immune activation."],

We find that intra-individual B. fragilis populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, preserving years of within-person history. This history reveals multiple signatures of within-person adaptation, including parallel evolution in sixteen genes. Many of these genes are implicated in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization. Tracking evolutionary trajectories using near-daily metagenomic sampling, we find evidence for years-long coexistence in one subject despite adaptive dynamics. We used public metagenomes to investigate one adaptive mutation common in our cohort and found that it emerges frequently in Western, but not Chinese, microbiomes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that B. fragilis adapts within individual microbiomes, pointing to factors that promote long-term gut colonization."],

	"text": ["Adipose tissue is a complex, essential, and highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Besides adipocytes, adipose tissue contains connective tissue matrix, nerve tissue, stromovascular cells, and immune cells. Together these components function as an integrated unit. Adipose tissue not only responds to afferent signals from traditional hormone systems and the central nervous system but also expresses and secretes factors with important endocrine functions. These factors include leptin, other cytokines, adiponectin, complement components, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, proteins of the renin-angiotensin system, and resistin. Adipose tissue is also a major site for metabolism of sex steroids and glucocorticoids. The important endocrine function of adipose tissue is emphasized by the adverse metabolic consequences of both adipose tissue excess and deficiency. A better understanding of the endocrine function of adipose tissue will likely lead to more rational therapy for these increasingly prevalent disorders. This review presents an overview of the endocrine functions of adipose tissue."],

	"text": ["Obesity is characterized by increased storage of fatty acids in an expanded adipose tissue mass and is closely associated with the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and the liver. In addition to being the largest source of fuel in the body, adipose tissue and resident macrophages are also the source of a number of secreted proteins. Cloning of the obese gene and the identification of its product, leptin, was one of the first discoveries of an adipocyte-derived signaling molecule and established an important role for adipose tissue as an endocrine organ. Since then, leptin has been found to have a profound role in the regulation of whole-body metabolism by stimulating energy expenditure, inhibiting food intake and restoring euglycemia, however, in most cases of obesity leptin resistance limits its biological efficacy. In contrast to leptin, adiponectin secretion is often diminished in obesity. Adiponectin acts to increase insulin sensitivity, fatty acid oxidation, as well as energy expenditure and reduces the production of glucose by the liver. Resistin and retinol binding protein-4 are less well described. Their expression levels are positively correlated with adiposity and they are both implicated in the development of insulin resistance. More recently it has been acknowledged that macrophages are an important part of the secretory function of adipose tissue and the main source of inflammatory cyokines, such as TNFα and IL-6. An increase in circulating levels of these macrophage-derived factors in obesity leads to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that has been linked to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. These proteins commonly known as adipokines are central to the dynamic control of energy metabolism, communicating the nutrient status of the organism with the tissues responsible for controlling both energy intake and expenditure as well as insulin sensitivity."],

This covers 28 foods separated into six food categories, then measured insulin response", "The aim of this study was to systematically compare postprandial insulin responses to isoenergetic 1000-kJ (240-kcal) portions of several common foods. Correlations with nutrient content were determined. Thirty-eight foods separated into six food categories (fruit, bakery products, snacks, carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, and breakfast cereals) were fed to groups of 11-13 healthy subjects. Finger-prick blood samples were obtained every 15 min over 120 min. An insulin score was calculated from the area under the insulin response curve for each food with use of white bread as the reference food (score = 100%). Significant differences in insulin score were found both within and among the food categories and also among foods containing a similar amount of carbohydrate. Overall, glucose and insulin scores were highly correlated (r = 0.70, P < 0.001, n = 38). However, protein-rich foods and bakery products (rich in fat and refined carbohydrate) elicited insulin responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic responses. Total carbohydrate (r = 0.39, P < 0.05, n = 36) and sugar (r = 0.36, P < 0.05, n = 36) contents were positively related to the mean insulin scores, whereas fat (r = -0.27, NS, n = 36) and protein (r = -0.24, NS, n = 38) contents were negatively related. Consideration of insulin scores may be relevant to the dietary management and pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia and may help increase the accuracy of estimating preprandial insulin requirements."],
